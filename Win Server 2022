  AD DS is a microsoft server role that manages and stores information about users,devices and services  on a network
  How does AD DS work? 
     Stores information in a hierarchical structure
     Authenticates users before they can access network resources
     Controls access to directory resources
     Uses Domain Name System (DNS) to help clients find domain controllers

  select active directory dommain services  click on add featured then next until install

2-Promote the server to a domain controller

-select add new forest -> give the root domain name (myAd.local) click next, give a password(ie activeDirectory2) and then next until you install(after installation your server will restart).

3- Create users for the new domain

  -Go to tools ->Active Directory Users and computers
  - the folder builtin contains the different groups
