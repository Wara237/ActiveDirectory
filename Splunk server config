 Here are the different config i have applied in splunk serveur:

1- Change the dynamic address to stadic:
    
  sudo nano /etc/net-plan/00-installer-config.yaml
  got to *dhcp = no them type in the next line with same colon *addresses : [192.168.10.10/24] this is the address of the computer
  next line, type *nameserver: 
  go to the next line inside near the s of server and type *addresses : [8.8.8.8] this is the DNS server (for google)
  next line same colon ad nameserver, type *routes : 
                                            -to: default
                                             via: 192.168.10.1 ( the default gateway)
